# Tiny URL

Tiny URL is a simple URL-shortening application built with Express.js. It transforms long URLs into short, easy-to-share links, similar to services like bit.ly or TinyURL. This project is a great starting point for learning about server-side applications, REST APIs, and database interactions in JavaScript.


## Installation

## Features
URL Shortening: Takes a long URL and converts it into a shorter version, which redirects to the original URL.
Custom Short Codes: Optionally, users can specify their own short codes.
## How It Works
1. User Input: The user submits a long URL through a form or API request.
2. Generate a Short URL: A unique short code is generated (or accepted if specified) and mapped to the original URL.
## Technologies Used
* Node.js & Express.js: Backend framework to handle requests and routing.
* JavaScript: Core language for both backend and frontend scripting.
* HTML/CSS: Basic frontend to interact with the API
